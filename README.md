## History of the Hangman Game

The Hangman game was originated from 17th century Europe and was first introduced as “Rite of Words and Life.” This was played or rather was demanded by prisoners facing death penalty. Due to its dark beginnings, the game has been modified in a variety of ways to appear more kid friendly. In this case the game was adjusted to be “Build your House on Solid Ground-Game”. Until this day the hangman game still is one of the popular classroom, paper and pencil guessing game.

#### **How It Works**

Blank line spaces of a particular word are presented by the host. The player/s then guess the word by calling out letter by letter. The right guesses will be revealed and the blanks replaced by the letter. With each wrong guess, however a drawing of a hangman comes together line by line or body part by body part. The game ends either by guessing the word right or by a complete drawing of the hangman, which means that game is lost.

#### **Benefits**

It is said that playing hangman will extend the existing vocabulary knowledge and spelling. It enhances cognitive skills and improves analytical thinking as the player must think of a strategy of calling out specific letters in a certain order. Moreover, it is a wonderful source of entertainment.

## BEM Methodology

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS, originally developed by Yandex. It is designed to create reusable, modular, and maintainable code.

#### BEM Structure

BEM divides the user interface into independent blocks, which can be reused across different parts of the application. The naming convention follows a specific structure:

- **Block**: The top-level component or a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
  - Example: `header`, `container`, `menu`
- **Element**: A part of a block that performs a certain function and has no standalone meaning.
  - Example: `header__title`, `menu__item`
- **Modifier**: A flag on a block or an element that changes its appearance or behavior.
  - Example: `menu__item--active`, `header--large`

#### Naming Convention

The BEM naming convention uses a double underscore (`__`) to separate elements from their block and a double hyphen (`--`) to separate modifiers from blocks or elements.

- **Block**: `block-name`
- **Element**: `block-name__element-name`
- **Modifier**: `block-name--modifier-name` or `block-name__element-name--modifier-name`

#### Example

```html
<div class="menu">
  <ul class="menu__list">
    <li class="menu__item menu__item--active">Home</li>
    <li class="menu__item">About</li>
    <li class="menu__item">Contact</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

In this example:

- `menu` is the block.
- `menu__list` and `menu__item` are elements of the menu block.
- `menu__item--active` is a modifier that changes the appearance of the `menu__item` element.

#### Benefits of BEM

1. **Clarity and Readability:** BEM makes it clear what each class refers to by looking at its name. It is easy to identify whether a class represents a block, an element, or a modifier.

2. **Modularity:** BEM promotes the creation of independent components. Each block is standalone, making it easier to reuse and maintain.

3. **Avoids Naming Conflicts:** The structured naming convention helps avoid class name conflicts, which are common in larger projects with many contributors.

4. **Improved Maintainability:** With BEM, the CSS and HTML structure is more organized, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify the code.

5. **Enhanced Scalability**: BEM's approach is particularly useful for large projects as it provides a consistent methodology for naming and structuring classes.

6. **Better Collaboration:** The clarity and structure provided by BEM make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project without confusion.
